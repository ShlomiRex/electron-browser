# electron-browser

Simple yet powerful library for implimenting browser in electron.

Each tab has its own webview, so every renderer is seperated from each other.

You can also add 'div' view, which allows any html content you want to use for the tab. This allows more control.

Comes with built int dark and light theme for the tabs.
